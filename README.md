  <p>Client Liaison is Melbournes Harvey Miller and Monte Morgan. The duo is renowned for their strong appreciation of the Australian identity  particularly an era of long lunches, company cards and Ansett Australia. Their synth-pop jams dipped in cosmopolitan shades of 80s, come to life on stage with retro choreographed dancers, coordinated dress, a few tins of Fosters, and triple js Tom Tilly on the bass. From selling out a national tour last year, visiting the US twice and with a debut album on the way we welcome Client Liaison.</p>

  <p>Daniel Dewan Sewell is Detroit-born rapper, Danny Brown. From kindergarten, Brown knew he wanted to be in hip-hop. After meeting and recording with Jay-Z’s Roc-A-Fella and 50 Cent’s G-Unit, it wasn’t until Brown released a series of local mixtapes and debut LP, ‘The Hybrid’ – that he signed with Fools Gold. Brown began to gain major recognition after the release of his second album ‘XXX ‘(2011), which earned him such awards as Spin’s #1 hip hop album of the year. His third album, ‘Old’ saw Brown work with a wide range of collaborators – from Rustie on “Attak” to Purity Ring on “25 Bucks”.  From touring with A$AP Rocky and Schoolboy Q, to writing his own children’s book - Danny Brown is one of hip-hop’s greatest assets.</p>

North Perth hip-hop artist Drapht first played Groovin the Moo in 2011. He has since won an ARIA for his album The Life of Riley, and last year gave us new single Dancin John Doe from the forthcoming record, 7 Mirrors. Collaborating with long-time producer and ally Dazastah, Dancin John Doe is about living your life without the cares of what other people think. Performing tunes like Jimmy Recard to Rapunzel, Drapht brings the flow to prove it.</p>
<h2>  DZ Deathrays </h2>
<p><a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/0qGPycvPHafmEPTOm4M7Tu"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"

They've since won an ARIA for their debut record Bloodstreams and countless praise for their second Black Rat. Theyve supported Foo Fighters, toured the US, UK, Europe, Asia and also Iceland. After playing a DJ Set at Groovin the Moo in 2013, they return three years later to bring their face-melting live show, ready to blow us away.</p>
<h2>  Emma Louise</h2>
<p><a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/1A96iePIMNFBjLrjXEl718"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"
	width="40"> </a></p>
<p>
Latest single, Underflow from solo artist Emma Louise offers a glimpse into a second album due for release this year. Louise created the single artwork herself for the track, and after capturing fans worldwide with her first hit Jungle and debut LP Head Vs Heart, its a joy to hear. Following on from supporting Sam Smith on his Australian tour late last year and collaborating with Flight Facilities, Louise has been busy working on her new live show - a must see at Groovin the Moo.</p>
<h2> Golden Features</h2>
<p><a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/2SrWifjYv7b5tR8EzEmn1x"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"
	width="40"> </a></p>
<p>
One of Australias fastest rising, and most mysterious producers is Golden Features. Breakout track Tell Me featuring Nicole Millar shook the airwaves following its first play on triple j in February 2014. Millions of plays later, Golden Features aka Sydney-based Tom Stell has made more than an entrance, he's done official remixes for the likes of Porter Robinson, released two EPs, and taken his music to the live arena, captivating crowds with his brooding electronic sounds - all from behind a signature golden mask. </p>

	width="40"> </a></p>
<p>
Compared to Jimi Hendrix for his guitar shredding skills, and having jammed with Prince, Melbourne singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer, Harts has come a long way. After opening the Moolin Rouge stage in Bendigo last year, Darren Hart aka Harts returns in 2016 to join the full tour. Single-handedly he writes, records and produces his own songs from his bedroom studio, making funked-up fusions of soul, pop and rock. His debut album Daydreamer and following Breakthrough EP had fans raving and soon he'll bring his electrified tunes to the stage, juggling between guitar, keyboard, bass and vocals.</p>
<h2> Illy</h2>
<p><a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/6NFyaN9PMCDZ3LKxGwHAXt"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"

After winning an ARIA award for his third record Bring It Back and releasing the platinum track Tightrope with San Ciscos Scarlett Stevens off the Cinematic LP, Illy drops the new single Swear Jar.

After 192 performances across 15 different countries in 2015, four-piece In Hearts Wake are ready to return home for their victory lap. Fresh off the release of their third album Skydancer, the Byron Bay metalcore outfit are ready to take on Moo. In Hearts Wake have built themselves a well-deserved reputation for ambitious, heartfelt songwriting with dynamic, blistering live shows that exceed all expectations. </p>
<h2>MS MR (USA) </h2>
<p><a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/4XaUmUGjidSklcDHxv3XWf"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"
	width="40"> </a></p>
<p>
After what was an enormous 2015, touring Europe and opening for the likes of Imagine Dragons in US mammoth-sized venues, MS MR will touch down in Australia for a trip to the Moo. After first catching attention with the 2012 single, Hurricane, the New York and LA-based duo have continued to break hearts and minds with their bittersweet, eloquently written pop songs. Their second album How Does It Feel featured collaborations with Tove Lo and captured fans across the world.  </p>
<h2> Ngaiire</h2>
<p><a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/4XaUmUGjidSklcDHxv3XWf"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"
	width="40"> </a></p>
<p>
Sydney-based Ngaiire (pronounced nyree) was born in Papua New Guinea and grew up in New Zealand. Moving to Sydney, and after a childhood spent listening to everyone from Mariah Carey to Jeff Buckley, Ngaiire began to make music, releasing her future brand of soul that has seen her make friends with Paul Mac and play Glastonbury. Her spell-binding cover of Tame Impalas Less I Know the Better for triple js Like A Version was a 2015 highlight.  Close to releasing her second album Blastoma, Ngaiire brings her powerful live show to Groovin the Moo. </p>
<h2> ODESZA (USA) </h2>
<p><a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/21mKp7DqtSNHhCAU2ugvUw"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"
	width="40"> </a></p>
<p>
ODESZA are Harrison Mills and Clayton Knight from Seattle. The pair met at university and in their final year, began to make music together. They released their debut album, Summers Gone, in 2012, scoring two number one hits on Hype Machine for How Did I Get Here and iPlayYouListen. Theyve since released their second LP, had 15 tracks top Hype Machine and last year started their own label, releasing music from the likes of Jai Wolf and RUFUS. Having toured the world relentlessly, see the pair master their mood-lifting electronic pop live at Groovin the Moo.</p>
<h2> Ratatat (USA)</h2>
<p><a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/57dN52uHvrHOxijzpIgu3E"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"
	width="40"> </a></p>
<p>
After five years of waiting, Ratatat released their fifth album last year  Magnifique. Recorded between Jamaica, Port Antonio and several spots in New York, the Brooklyn-based duo named it their strongest record yet. Combining elements of their early guitar-driven sounds with later experimental beats, the result is nothing short of glorious. The pair first played Groovin the Moo in 2009, and now with their reputation for psychedelic live shows and visuals by one-half of the duo, expect to be mesmerized. </p>
<h2> REMI</h2>
<p><a href="https://play.spotify.com/artist/5t69dnux4K2vcJO4VjS39q"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"
	width="40"> </a></p>
<p>
Melbourne hip-hop artist REMI made a surprise visit to Bendigos Groovin the Moo last year, when he jumped on stage with The Delta Riggs for a rendition of their track Hey Victor. This year, fresh from performing to sold-out crowds across Europe and Australia, he brings his own show to the Moo. Between releasing the debut album Raw X Infinity, the mixtape, Call It What You Want and supporting fellow Moo acts, Danny Brown and Vic Mensa on tour, we recommend you arrive for REMI.</p>
<h2>  The Rubens</h2>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/11gWrKZMBsGQWmobv3oNfW"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"
	width="40"> </a></p>
<p>
Five-piece, The Rubens, have done their hometown proud with recent success. The three Margin brothers, Sam, Elliott, Zaac, alongside Scott and William from rural town Menangle, NSW, saw their debut self-titled album go platinum in Australia, and their second LP ‘HOOPS’ reach number two on the charts. They’ve since sold out a 22-date national tour, and have everyone from Vogue to Rolling Stone writing about them. From tunes like “My Gun”, 2011’s “Lay It Down” and last year’s “Hoops” – The Rubens deliver raw, indie rock like no other.</p>
<h2> SAFIA </h2>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/11gWrKZMBsGQWmobv3oNfW"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"
	width="40"> </a></p>
<p>
Canberra trio - Ben Woolner, Michael Bell and Harry Sayers are SAFIA. The three-piece have come a long way since their debut track Listen to Soul, Listen to Blues in 2013. Theyve supported Lorde, reached #1 on Hype Machine, toured Europe, and scored double platinum with Peking Duk on the collab, Take Me Over. Last year, their tunes Embracing Me and Counting Sheep were two of the biggest, and we cant wait for their debut album in 2016. </p>
<h2> Twenty One Pilots (USA)</h2>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/11gWrKZMBsGQWmobv3oNfW"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"
	width="40"> </a></p>
<p> 
Columbus Ohio-based duo, Twenty-One Pilots aka Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun, call their music schizoid-pop. The pair released their latest album ‘Blurryface’ last year – and had over 10 million people listen in on Spotify. Their previous album ‘Vessel’ in 2013 saw the group embark on over 325 shows worldwide. From the studio to the stage, the band always keep their live shows in mind, and are known for bringing high-energy anthems – ready to lift Groovin the Moo.</p>
<h2>  Vallis Alps</h2>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/11gWrKZMBsGQWmobv3oNfW"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"
	width="40"> </a></p>
<p>
Via Canberra and Seattle is electronic duo, Vallis Alps. The pair has us under a spell with their dreamy, down-tempo electro-pop. With Parissas ethereal vocals, and Davids production, the duo released their independent self-titled EP at the beginning of last year  and have since clocked themselves 10+ million Soundcloud plays, and a #1 spot on Hype Machine. Recently becoming a triple j Unearthed feature artist, theyre one of the quickest rising acts in eloquent and elegant pop music.</p>
<h2>WHAT SO NOT </h2>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/11gWrKZMBsGQWmobv3oNfW"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"
	width="40"> </a></p>
<p>
If it weren’t for its pedigree it would be ok to call What So Not an overnight sensation. From festival plays at Coachella, Pukkelpop, Ultra and Lollapalooza rubbing shoulders with Skrillex and RL Grime, What So Not has justified the hype.  An ever-evolving and surprising sound that includes anthems such as Gemini (ft. George Maple), Jaguar, High You Are and Tell Me (with RL Grime) makes it impossible to pigeonhole. 

WHAT SO NOT: the overnight success 4 years in the making.  </p>
<h2> Amrita Hepi's Pop Culture Dance Class </h2>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/11gWrKZMBsGQWmobv3oNfW"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"
	width="40"> </a></p>
<p>
Amrita Hepi is a dance maker, word shaper and radio host. You can find her creating movement in most places in Sydney and abroad. She is also a descendant of the Bundjulung (NSW) and Ngapuhi (NZ) people and believes that her ancestors blessed her with rhythm and a strong political force. She will be guiding you through a uniquely unbielebable experience. At the end of 2015 there was a change in the air, something shifted in pop culture. To immortalise this transition GTM is holding its very first "unbielebable" Pop Culture Dance Class. We'll be recapping the dancehall moves including all the vibrations and gyrations - this is a beginners class and a no-shame zone (its also dark, sweaty, loud and most importantly fun) all shapes and levels welcome. You'll be in the safe and super capable hand of one of our fave dance makers Amrita Hepi.</p>
<h2> Genesis Owusu</h2>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/11gWrKZMBsGQWmobv3oNfW"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"
	width="40"> </a></p>
<p> 
Genesis Owusu is a young and up-and-coming wordsmith; notably recognised as a vibrant half of duo, The Ansah Brothers, with brother, Citizen Kay, as well as being 2015's only hip hop addition in the finals of triple j's Unearthed High competition with his single "The Day After Valentine's". Off of the heels of The Ansah Brothers' 2015 release "Polaroid", Genesis currently prepares to unveil his debut solo release "CARDRIVE EP", with a sound distinct from any of his rap peers. Owusu's soulful jazz tones definitely shouldn't fool you into thinking he won't viciously tear apart a microphone with a linguistic banger at any point throughout a set.</p>
<h2> Gordi</h2>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/11gWrKZMBsGQWmobv3oNfW"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"
	width="40"> </a></p>
<p>
22 year old Sydney folktronica artist Gordi caused a stir in late 2014 and early 2015 with her luminous indie pop songs ‘Nothing’s As It Seems’, ‘Taken Blame’ and ‘Can We Work It Out’ being picked up by triple j and community radio around Australia as well as attracting international interests from tastemaker blogs, radio and showcase events, drawing comparison to Asgeir, Tallest Man on Earth and Angel Olsen. With nominations for a triple j  “J Award” and 2 FBi Radio SMAC Awards, Gordi’s debut EP is out in 2016 and is set to take your breathe away.</p>
<h2>Hockey Dad </h2>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/11gWrKZMBsGQWmobv3oNfW"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"
	width="40"> </a></p>
<p> 
Hockey Dad is Zach Stephenson & Billy Fleming, two childhood sweethearts who met when Billy dropped in on Zach surfing the point, at the tender age of 4. One day, after a few finger paintings and their daily nap, Billy & Zach made a pact to become the greatest band… out of Windang.

Fast forward a few years (about 13) and the boys still have their afternoon nap, only now it’s after surfs or jams, and often both. Combining their passion for the ocean with a love for garage and old school 60’s surf tunes, Hockey Dad write some catchy-as-hell pop hits & are ready to share them across the country… as long as there’s a beach.

<h2>  LTC</h2>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/11gWrKZMBsGQWmobv3oNfW"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"

<p>
triple j unearthed winner, Turquoise Prince LTC aka 22 year old Teon Lolesio first took interest in music in High School at the age of 15; with Guitar & Keyboard being his first instruments of choice. However this is also where Teon discovered that his real passion was singing. Over the last 5 years Teon has fined tuned his voice in his home town Canberra, and been lucky enough to team up with some of Australia's best producers, resulting in a plethora of music; some already in the market, and some soon to be on our air waves.

triple j and triple j unearthed have both played a massive roll already in getting his music heard and have supported him along the short but escalating journey, his brother from another mother Hau (triple j) brought Teon into the studio to co-write skip-hop which featured on The No End Theory and was shortlisted in the 2015 triple j Hottest 100. Hau is not the only one at triple j though who is backing LTC, Dom Alessio featured 'Bangers & Mash' in his Home & Hosed Top 5 tracks of the week, which also gained spot play on the station. Teon has just started his solo live shows but already had the pleasure of co-headlining with Allday & Carmada at The MET Brisbane, and then co-headlining The Helm Mooloolaba with Nina Las Vegas on NYE. The sky is the limit for this promising young talent, and we are excited to see his journey unfold</p>
<h2> Polish Club </h2>
<p><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/11gWrKZMBsGQWmobv3oNfW"> <img src="social icons/spotify-4096-black.png" height="40"
	width="40"> </a></p>
<p> 
To be ‘loud’ is something both scientifically quantifiable and emotional. Certain bands are one kind, some are the other. Polish Club is both.
There are two of them. They are called Novak and John-Henry and are the loudest goddamn soul outfit you’ve ever heard. (And yes, they are both sort of Polish.)
 
John-Henry is the drummer. He’s very good at hitting three separate things at once with great gravity. Novak’s the singer. He also plays a beautifully brash blues guitar, but you won’t remember that after you hear his voice, so just make a mental note of it now.
Polish Club write pop songs fifty years late and twice the speed. In any one of their numbers, which barely nip at the three minute mark, the full-bodied how of Motown’s finest frontmen is parsed through the garage rock scuzz of Detroit.
 </p>
<h2> THE PLOT</h2>
